# About

Starting my career in 2008 with a focus on PHP, I switched to Ruby full-time in 2014 and found a happiness in programming that I didnâ€™t know was possible.

During my career to date, whether I am working alone on a project, or as part of a larger team, I strive to create a positive environment whilst producing the best possible end product.

# Articles

From time to time I'll find a subject that I find interesting enough to write about, with the hope that I might be able to pass on some small bits of knowledge to others.
